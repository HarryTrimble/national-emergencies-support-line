      <p class="govuk-body">National Emergencies Support Line is a free service for people to access support in emergencies. The support line is operated by <a href="https://www.victimsupport.org.uk/">Victim Support</a>, <a href="https://www.redcross.org.uk/">British Red Cross</a> and <a href="https://www.samaritans.org/">Samaritans</a>.
      
      <p>The support line provides one single point of contact for the public when there is a serious incident or emergency.</p>
      
      <p>The number is free to call and will be promoted as soon as an emergency is declared.</p>
      
      <p>Those answering calls will deal directly with people's needs or swiftly signpost them to where to go for the support they need.</p>

      <p>The support line wonâ€™t be promoted in every emergency.</p>

      <p>When it is promoted it will be during a major emergency. This will be agreed by:</p>  
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Victim Support </li>
        <li>British Red Cross</li>
      </ul>

      <p>British Red Cross or Victim Support will request for your organisation to signpost people to the support line. They will discuss this with your organisation through official channels during an emergency.</p>

      <p><a href="/templates">Comms templates</a> are available for signposting people to the support line.</p>

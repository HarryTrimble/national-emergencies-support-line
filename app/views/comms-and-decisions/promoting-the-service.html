      <p>The support line wonâ€™t be promoted in every emergency.</p>

      <p>When it is promoted it will be during a major emergency. This will be agreed by:</p>  
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Victim Support </li>
        <li>British Red Cross</li>
      </ul>

      <p>British Red Cross or Victim Support will recommend when to promote the support line. They will communicate this to your organisation through official channels during an emergency.</p>

      <p><a href="/comms-and-decisions/templates">Comms templates</a> are available for promoting the support line.</p>
